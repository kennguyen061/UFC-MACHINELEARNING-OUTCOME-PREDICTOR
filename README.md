# UFC MACHINE LEARNING OUTCOME PREDICOTR

## DESCRIPTION
Python built machine-learning algorithm using Logistic Regression and Cross-Validation with the help of Pandas and the scikit-learn library. Model built as of 1/26/25.  
Algorithm is built to predict the binary outcome of a MMA fight (win/loss) with the help of data from ufcstats.com (Model is 67.68% accurate at predicting fights).

## Flaws of algorithm
- Fights outside of UFC do not have data, making fights involving debuting fighters impossible to predict
- Does not account for athlete regression due to age
- Does not account for injuries from previous fight
- Does not account for athletes returning after a long lay off
